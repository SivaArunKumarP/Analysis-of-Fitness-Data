# Analysis-of-Fitness-Data

This project involves the analysis of a fitness dataset collected from RunKeeperâ€”a popular fitness tracking application. This is data about several types of training activities: running, cycling, or even unicycling. The goal of the project is to import user data and cleanse it for analysis regarding questions to their training progress, achievements, and performance compared with others. In data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis, this project includes 11 tasks: mean imputation, plotting running data, computation of annual and weekly means, and plot creation to understand relationships between variables. 

This project is powered by Python, along with its popular libraries Pandas and Matplotlib, to import, clean, and analyze data. Such results would provide insight into the fitness journey of users, show where improvements should really be made, and compare with others. Results like this on a different fitness dataset are also of importance not only to the user but also to the professional level.
